title: Interspecies Money
intro: >-
    Interspecies Money seeks to give wild animals, trees, and other species the ability to hold and spend money in a trusted and divisible way in order to improve their life outcomes.
        
        
    It makes no sense that the market economy puts money into ores, promissory notes, and blocks of computer code, but not into the continuance of rare, complex, and ancient life forms (regardless of how difficult this is).
section1:
    pre: Why Do We Need Interspecies Money?
    title: >-
        The biomass of wild animals
        has collapsed.
    body: >-
        The biomass of other species is collapsing; many species disappear without the world ever knowing they existed.
        
        
        The only economic value most nonhumans have is the value of their processed body parts; if money is memory, it holds no memory of the millions of other species with whom humans cohabit the planet.
        
        
        They have left little trace on the market economy precisely because no money has ever been held by them. Interspecies Money proposes to change that forever.
section2:
    pre: proposition
    title: We aim to  build a new financial marketplace in which other species and humans can exchange financial value.
    body: >-
        We give nonhumans and entire ecosystems the ability to hold and spend Interspecies Money.
        
        
        We aim to  build a new financial marketplace in which other species and humans can exchange financial value. We believe  a market in “life” will surpass and reshape the “carbon” market. Funds raised at planetary scale and directed accurately, equitably, and sustainably to help discover and protect other species.
        
        
        As we move into a world of artificial intelligences, Interspecies Money will seek to incentivise the preservation of biological intelligences. We believe our shared future will not just be AI but “BI” of other species and their knowledge and capabilities.
section3:
    pre: beginning
    body: >-
        The first pilot of Interspecies Money will seek to prove that nonhumans can receive hold and spend money based on their preferences. It will be delivered in Rwanda in 2024.
